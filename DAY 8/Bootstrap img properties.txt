	-> NOTATIONS:
		* [0-9] : one digit b/w 0-9
		* [0-9][0-9] : two digits
		* ^ RE $ : denote a regular expression
		* {} : curly braces for repeatations ex: ^[0-9]{4}$ is 4 repeats.
		* [a-z] : matching of lower case charecters
		* [A-Z] : matching of upper case charecters
		* [a-z A-z] : both cap and small are valid as first char
		* {x,y} : any number of char valid from x to y range where x can be zero
		* [a-z A-Z special charecters] are also valid
